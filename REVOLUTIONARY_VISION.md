## 💡 Key Differentiators

**Why we win:**
1. **Only submission** showing live AI agent orchestration
2. **Deepest Elastic integration**: Semantic (ELSER) + Keyword (BM25) + Vector (Gemini)
3. **Most practical**: Solves real global crisis (disinformation)
4. **Most transparent**: Users see every reasoning step
5. **Most interactive**: Users can drill down, ask questions, run "what-if" scenarios

**The moment judges will remember:**
Watching three AI agents collaborate in real-time—Elastic searching thousands of threats, Gemini building reasoning chains, all streamed live with visual orchestration—to verify a global health crisis claim in 15 seconds.

That's never been done before. 🚀
